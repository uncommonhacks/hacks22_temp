  <h3>About</h3>	

  <p>
    Founded in 2016, Uncommon Hacks is a weekend-long celebration of technology where college students worldwide come to Chicago to make fun, 
    random, and innovative tech-related projects with friends old and new. Every year, we work hard to create a hackathon where all are welcome, 
    regardless of experience or background, and where outside-the-box projects and creative thinking are encouraged. For our sixth annual hackathon 
    last spring, we hosted over 200 of the brightest and most motivated students from universities around the world. You can get an idea of what goes 
    on at Uncommon Hacks by checking out our <a href = "https://youtu.be/p2X63fVdIIY" id = "a_header">recap video from 2019</a>.

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hackathons are invention marathons where attendees collaborate on a project over the course of a weekend! Hackers will be in a fun, supportive 
        environment with the necessary tools and mentorship provided to create weird, quirky, and amazing projects that creatively explore new ideas 
        with code or solve unconventional problems.
        
        University and high school students from anywhere are welcome, even if you're not a computer science major or have never been to a hackathon 
        before! We've written a guide for first-time hackers available <a href="https://github.com/uncommonhacks/guide-virtual" id ="a_body">here</a>.

      <p>April 1st - 3rd, 2022 -- HYBRID

        <br><br>

        HYBRID: If you're a UChicago student, you're welcome to attend the event in-person. 
        Non-UChicago students unfortunately will not be allowed to attend the event in-person, 
        though all are open to attend the hackathon virtually. The same programming will be available 
        for both in-person and virtual participants, so don't fret either way! 
        
        <br><br>

        WHERE: If you're attending in-person, we'll be having an assortment of in-person events 
        on the UChicago campus, as well as some virtual events. Details of locations and times will 
        be sent to in-person participants in advance. If attending virtually, all links and info will
        be included in our hacker guide, which will be sent out before the event begins. We anticipate 
        using Gather.Town and Discord for all hackers!

        <br><br>

        Uncommon Hacks is free to attend. We will not offer travel reimbursement. If you're participating 
        virtually, the only traveling you'll be doing is to our Gather.Town...for which you'll be reimbursed 
        with e-love.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ what does the application process and timeline look like?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The process starts out with the hackathon application, which consists of basic demographic questions 
        as well as a few ~mystery~ short answer ones. The Uncommon Hacks team will be reviewing the applications 
        in waves, and you will be notified via email with the result of your application. If you've been accepted, 
        you will have an RSVP link to complete as confirmation of your attendance. from there, you're all set - 
        see you on our adventure!

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ what can I make and who can I work with?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>You are encouraged to work in teams of up to four (4) people! Collaborating with hackers across 
        different schools is especially welcome. We will offer plenty of opportunities for you to meet new 
        people and make teams.

    <div class="content">
      <p>We welcome everyone to apply, regardless of your background in tech! Even if you have limited 
        coding or technical experience, we will have plenty of talks and workshops scheduled to introduce 
        you to a plethora of different tools and technologies. We will also have mentors available throughout 
        the weekend to help out if you ever get stuck or run out of ideas.</p>
